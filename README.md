## Student and Schools Data Visualization
This project is designed to visualize student and school data using Flask, a Python web
framework. By providing the count of students and the names of schools, the application will 
generate a visual representation of this data for better understanding and analysis.
## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

&#8226; Python (3.6 or higher)

&#8226; Flask ('pip install flask')

&#8226; Plotly ('pip install plotly')

## Getting Started
1.Clone the repository:

https://github.com/Prasanna1818/students-data-visualization.git

2.Navigate to the project directory:

cd students and schools

3.Run the Flask application:

python app.py




## Usage
1.Input the number of students associated with each school and the names of the schools into the provided form fields.

2.Click on the "Submit" button to generate the visualization.

3.The application will display a dynamic visualization (such as a bar chart or pie chart) based on the input data, showing the distribution of students across different schools.

## Example
Suppose you have the following data:

School A: 100 students

School B: 150 students

School C: 80 students

Input this data into the application and click "Submit". The application will render a chart showing the student distribution among schools.

## Technologies Used
&#8226;Python

&#8226;Flask

&#8226;Plotly (for interactive data visualization)
